The following effects are not prevented by this move: * acupressure from an ally * curse's curse effect * Delayed damage from doom desire and future sight; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn * feint, which will also end this move's protection after it hits * imprison * perish song * shadow force * Moves that merely copy the user, such as transform or psych up This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.

Disables moves and immunities that involve flying or levitating for five turns.
For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled. For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages. Cancels the effects of bounce, fly, and sky drop. Specifically, flying Pokémon and those with levitate or that have used magnet rise are no longer immune to ground attacks, arena trap, spikes, or toxic spikes. bounce, fly, sky drop, high jump kick, jump kick, and splash cannot be used while this move is in effect. *Bug*: If this move is used during a double or triple battle while Pokémon are under the effect of sky drop, Sky Drop's effect is not correctly canceled on its target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely. As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it.

Ensures that the user's next move will hit the target.
If the user targets the same target again before the end of the next turn, the move it uses is guaranteed to hit. This move itself also ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers. One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target. This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as dig or fly. If the target uses detect or protect while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection. This effect is passed on by baton pass.

Transfers 1/4 of the user's max HP into a doll, protecting the user from further damage or status changes until it breaks.
Transfers 1/4 the user's max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail. If the user leaves the field, the doll will vanish. If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail. The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero. Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed. Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal. Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move. The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching. The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect. Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate. Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry. magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block. Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal. It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn. A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep. The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist. If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked. life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll. The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes. The doll is passed on by baton pass. It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation. All other effects work as normal.

Carries the target high into the air, dodging all attacks against either, and drops it next turn.
Inflicts regular damage. User carries the target high into the air for one turn, during which no moves will hit either Pokémon and neither can act. On the following turn, the user drops the target, inflicting damage and ending the effect. If the target is flying-type, this move will function as normal but inflict no damage. gust, hurricane, sky uppercut, smack down, thunder, twister, and whirlwind can hit both the user and the target during this effect. gust and twister will additionally have double power. The damage from hail and sandstorm still applies during this effect. Either Pokémon may be hit during this effect if also under the effect of lock on, mind reader, or no guard. This move cannot be used while gravity is in effect. This move cannot be selected by sleep talk. *Bug*: If gravity is used during a double or triple battle while this move is in effect, this move is not correctly canceled on the target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely. As this move prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it.

Power and type depend upon user's IVs. Power can range from 30 to 70.
Inflicts regular damage. Power and type are determined by the user's IVs. Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`. `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order. (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`. `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.) Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive. Average power is 49.5. Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0. (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.) The result is looked up in the following table. Value | Type ----: | --------  0 | fighting  1 | flying  2 | poison  3 | ground  4 | rock  5 | bug  6 | ghost  7 | steel  8 | fire  9 | water  10 | grass  11 | electric  12 | psychic  13 | ice  14 | dragon  15 | dark This move thus cannot be normal. Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random IVs. However, due to the flooring used here, bug, fighting, and grass appear 5/64 of the time, and dark only 1/64 of the time.

Steals the target's move, if it's self-targeted.
The next time a Pokémon uses a beneficial move on itself or itself and its ally this turn, the user of this move will steal the move and use it itself. Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the "snatchable" flag. If two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again--thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect. If the user steals psych up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych up. If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP. This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome.

User and target swap items.
User and target permanently swap held items. Works even if one of the Pokémon isn't holding anything. If either Pokémon is holding mail, this move will fail. If either Pokémon has multitype or sticky hold, this move will fail. If this move results in a Pokémon obtaining choice band, choice scarf, or choice specs, and that Pokémon was the latter of the pair to move this turn, then the move it used this turn becomes its chosen forced move. This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used. If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn. Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle. This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.
Trick
The user catches the target off guard and swaps its held item with its own.
