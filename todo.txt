OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView, 
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.
	
	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?
	
Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going 
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would 
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another 
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for 
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the 
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles. 

Look into rewriting MoldBreaker because it sucks
Semi-invulnerable moves shouldn't get a menu in between turns
Look at differences in Roar and other exit battle moves
There is a bug with the buttons in bag view particularly the give and take ones
Look at Forecast and Multitype again and the fix -- I don't think they actually work -- try paired with Illusion, should make some sort of changeType thing or use a similar effect that already exists, Protean should go in this category as well

Protean and Competitive abilities will affect non-gen6 Pokemon -- add these in

Ask Josh if High Jump Kick will still fit everywhere since it is now the longest move name
Ask Josh how to give a trainer Pokemon a held item

Diancie needs a base exp yield and a capture rate whenever that gets updated

Things to test:
	EffectBlockerEffect
	EndBattleEffect
	EndTurnEffect
	StatusPreventionEffect
	WeatherBlockerEffect
	TrappingEffect
	OpponentTrappingEffect
	EntryEffect
	
	StatProtectingEffect:
		if (this instanceof Ability && caster.breaksTheMold()) return false;
		
	Test fixed damage moves or basically anything that takes advantage of the new tryDamage method
