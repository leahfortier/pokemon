OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView, 
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.
	
	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?
	
Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going 
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would 
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another 
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for 
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the 
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles. 

There is a bug with the buttons in bag view particularly the give and take ones

Diancie needs a base exp yield and a capture rate whenever that gets updated

Things to test:
	EffectBlockerEffect
	EndBattleEffect
	EndTurnEffect
	StatusPreventionEffect
	WeatherBlockerEffect
	TrappingEffect
	OpponentTrappingEffect
	EntryEffect
	
	StatProtectingEffect:
		if (this instanceof Ability && caster.breaksTheMold()) return false;
		
	Test fixed damage moves or basically anything that takes advantage of the new tryDamage method

Should probably just let Nidoran be 100% male again

Pokemon that go out of bounds:
	Xerneas
	Aurorus
	
	We need to do whatever thing we did for levitating Pokemon before so it doesn't look like they're sitting on the ground... Wait actually we never did that -- that needs to happends srsly
