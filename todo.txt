OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView, 
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.
	
	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?
	
Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going 
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would 
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another 
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for 
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the 
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles. 

There is a bug with the buttons in bag view particularly the give and take ones

Diancie needs a base exp yield and a capture rate whenever that gets updated

Things to test:
	EffectBlockerEffect
	EndBattleEffect
	EndTurnEffect
	StatusPreventionEffect
	WeatherBlockerEffect
	TrappingEffect
	OpponentTrappingEffect
	EntryEffect
	
	StatProtectingEffect:
		if (this instanceof Ability && caster.breaksTheMold()) return false;
		
	Test fixed damage moves or basically anything that takes advantage of the new tryDamage method
	
Find a way to have multiple fields that are multiple words long:
	Combine switchItem and switchItemMessage
	combine abilityChange and AbilityMessage
	combine opptrappingeffect and message
	combine attackselection and message
	name change set and get
	status prevent and message
	stat protect and message
	bracing and message
	damage blocker and alternate effect
	
make sure default methods still work properly like critstage and groundedEffect
same with interfaces with no methods

Options menu:
	- Sound
	- Text Speed
	- Animation Speed
generalize catch animation again
invoke methods that need to call another method immediately after (boolean and void generally or boolean and String just for message)
connect interface gen with override input
create some sort of silph surboard for Silph Surfer evolution
self switching moves require input -- currently just switching to random
BERRIES
npc trading view
green hat sprites
move player trigger should be able to just set direction

Storyline:
	Professor Maple is no longer introduced except for through the bitchface who is optional -- maybe want to alter Mom's message to be more plot-focused and mention visiting the lab?
