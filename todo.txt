OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView, 
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.
	
	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?
	
Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going 
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would 
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another 
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for 
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the 
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles. 

Look into rewriting MoldBreaker because it sucks
Semi-invulnerable moves shouldn't get a menu in between turns
