OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView,
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.

	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?

Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles.

Storyline:
	Professor Maple is no longer introduced except for through the bitchface who is optional -- maybe want to alter Mom's message to be more plot-focused and mention visiting the lab?

Pokemon that go out of bounds:
	Xerneas
	Aurorus
	Kokonatsu

	We need to do whatever thing we did for levitating Pokemon before so it doesn't look like they're sitting on the ground... Wait actually we never did that -- that needs to happens srsly

Names that go out of bounds:
	Crabominable
	Disarming Voice
	Silph Surfer
    Lv100 (Enemy) Charmander has the gender sign overlap with the level
    BallItem text against a trainer goes out of bounds
    Synchronize ability text is wayyyy out of bounds on party view

Descriptions that change manually:
    Moves:
        Sky Drop (Remove 'The target cannot attack while in the sky.')
        Flower Shield ('The Defense stat of all Grass-type Pokémon in battle' -> 'its Defense stat')
        Rototiller ('the Attack and Sp. Atk stats of Grass-type Pokémon' -> 'its Attack and Sp. Atk stats')
        Magnetic Flux ('the Defense and Sp. Def stats of ally Pokémon with the Plus or Minus Ability' -> 'its Defense and Sp. Def stats')
        Gear Up ('the Attack and Sp. Atk stats of ally Pokémon with the Plus or Minus Ability' -> 'its Attack and Sp. Atk stats')
        Pollen Puff (Remove 'If the target is an ally, it gives the ally a pollen puff that restores its HP instead.')
        Aromatic Mist ('the Sp. Def stat of an ally Pokémon' -> 'its Sp. Def stat')
        Fairy Lock (Remove 'during the last turn')
    Abilities:
        Healer ('an ally's' -> 'its')
        Flower Veil (Remove 'Ally')
    Items:
        Fishing Rod
        Deep Sea Scale (Added ', Chinchou, or Lanturn' -- Lanturn rules and deserves this)
        Safari Ball (If it references some rando place)
        Razz Berry
        All the EV Decreasing Berries (Ex: Pomeg Berry) (Remove 'makes it more friendly but')
        
Other random things:
    Options menu:
        - Sound
        - Text Speed
        - Animation Speed
	generalize catch animation again
	invoke methods that need to call another method immediately after (boolean and void generally or boolean and String just for message)
	connect interface gen with override input
	create some sort of silph surboard for Silph Surfer evolution
	self switching moves require input -- currently just switching to random
	green hat sprites
	Riding up on bike on foreground tiles causes tiles to flash
	Mirror move executes multi-turn moves in a single turn
	Choose/give a TM for beating gym leaders
	Blue needs to be in the Pokemon Center after you battle him
	Make sure relearning moves works for evolve moves too
	Generalize double cast remove effects (example: Power Trick)
	Test for base evolutions don't have a move that they learn at evolution
	Test that Shedinja is genderless when it evolves and that it doesn't appear when you cancel evolution
	Make cast method final for effects and have a different method to handle additional things that need to happen so shit isn't always calling super
	Generalize activated field for single turn power multipliers (like Normalize)
	Remove mainMenuTiles (can keep some for reference inside the images folder) but def move out of tiles
		-- same with pauseViewTiles
	Berry harvest time and amounts
	Look at light screen and light clay cast thingy -- why is it not applying turns to itself?
	Change effects list for Defog and RapidSpin to only include PokemonEffect and TeamEffects
	should movetypes be a set?
	BasicPanels fullMessagePanel -- Is 440 game.height - panel.height?
	TileSet getTile should use readImage in FileIO -- just check exists first
	Exeggutor plant gives two Exeggutor?? -- got one, battled mom, got another? also got one, saved, got another
	MoveUseItems do not work in battle -- causes NPE
	Heal Block doesn't work right either
	rewrite Ability.evolutionAssign() to hold the ability index to remain consistent across evolutions
	Dancer -- test with Snatch (should not activate); test with Flinched (should not activate)
	test entering a new location while medals are displaying
	Explosion doesn't kill the user when used against a Ghost type Pokemon
	Rest shows the incorrect status prevent message -- just says "...but it failed!"
	can we throw a Pokeball at a semi-invulnerable Poke?
	Bag View messages for evolution and learn moves
    Test self-switching moves from 4th index to a Pokemon with less than four moves (I think the move index isn't getting rest -- will this indexoutofboundsexception?)
    should status cure moves be apply damage effects or unique effects?
    add brick break to defog/rapid spin tests
    quick guard apparently not affected by successive decay?
    beat up power was changed
    triple kick power is supposed to be 10, 20, 30
    foul play is all wrong
    acupressure should only try to raise non-maximized stats and should fail if all maxed out
    test healing wish and snatch
    okay so Mirror Move is supposed to use the last move that targeted the user, not the last move that the opponent used... what is happening I did not know this
    look at destiny bond and successive decay
    metronome + multi-turn move is not working (Dive)
    Wallet class (CashMoneyHouse?)
    change order of move list
    check flinch with multi turn moves -- should it always reset ready? or just for like smack down?
    can selfconfusion remove itself inside totalandcompletefailure?
    uproar specifically checks if pp runs out to remove effect -- should that be for other similar moves too?
    remove effect inside subside -- then we can use it in more places
    substitute almost certainly doesn't work with form change abilities for images at least (or transform etc)
    make Marcos fix the substitute failure messaging problems I don't wanna do it
    does using a berry (not hold item) not count as berry consumption??
    probably have something to automatically remove previous effect if there can only be one (ChangeAbility etc)
    should I get different sprites for Castform and Arceus and other Pokemon like that since it's partially setup now
    cancelling evolution still consumes evolution item
    is there some way to have like a FirstTriggeredCondition or something for things like items and a lot of other shit
    is there a way to just create the button transitions from the button list by using all the button locations or something like that??
    Al Bhed translation shouldn't be hardcoded -- just a flag on the area or something
        - so if you put the flag on the area then when you talk to the rival he speaks Al Bhed...
    uhhhhh so should I store the current battle on the player object???? would that just make everythinnnnggggggg better????
        - if I end up doing would definitely do the simulating check for medal case not everywhere
    should we have a new class to handle damage calculation shit and return an object with all relevant information (not just damage)
        - then it can also do the crit test and return the advantage (so is not calculated twice for message purposes)
        - like most of this stuff doesn't feel like it should be inside applyDamage -- that should just be applying the damage!!!! not printing/more calculating!!
    TestPokemon should also have assert[Not]Type method
    should probably have tests for moves that ignore stages
    can we delete powerModifierTest()? I really don't understand how it differs from powerChangeTest
    might make sense at this point to have types be their own classes (still enum like the namesies)
        - Powder moves with grass
        - lots and lots of status immunities etc
    should have an isWeather method on the battle
    do we already have a test that powerchangeeffects and such are never status moves
