OTHER THINGS
	TYLER - Switching Pokemon/Using an item needs to be able to send messages to the BattleView,
	right now you can do these things, but the health/status isn't updated, and there's no message
	saying that something happened. Also, we need small pokemonTiles.

	The player should turn in the direction you press, even if the tile is not passable.
	Can triggers take into account orientation (i.e. only trigger the water dialog when the user is facing the water)?

Am I allowed to edit this to? (Josh) - YES
MAP TILES
	Tyler - I have not seen the map editor yet, but when I was suggesting having multiple
	grass tiles, the editor should be the one to pick at random which tile to use. Also, going
	with your idea of having a two layered tile set, the only thing I can think of that would
	go on the background set would be grass tiles. Unless someone else comes up with another
	tile that would go in the background set, you could just render the default grass tile for
	the map in all locations and then draw the map as usual. Then again, to avoid all of the
	unnecessary rendering, I could just get Jeb to add grass tiles to the bottom of all tree tiles.

Storyline:
	Professor Maple is no longer introduced except for through the bitchface who is optional -- maybe want to alter Mom's message to be more plot-focused and mention visiting the lab?

Pokemon that go out of bounds:
	Xerneas
	Aurorus
	Kokonatsu

	We need to do whatever thing we did for levitating Pokemon before so it doesn't look like they're sitting on the ground... Wait actually we never did that -- that needs to happens srsly

Names that go out of bounds:
	Crabominable
	Disarming Voice
	Silph Surfer
    Lv100 (Enemy) Charmander has the gender sign overlap with the level
    BallItem text against a trainer goes out of bounds
    Synchronize ability text is wayyyy out of bounds on party view

	Test for base evolutions don't have a move that they learn at evolution
	Test that Shedinja is genderless when it evolves and that it doesn't appear when you cancel evolution
	Zeraora pokedex image doesn't look legit -- make sure that gets handled at some point
	Make cast method final for effects and have a different method to handle additional things that need to happen so shit isn't always calling super

	Remove mainMenuTiles (can keep some for reference inside the images folder) but def move out of tiles
		-- same with pauseViewTiles
	Berry harvest time and amounts

	Change effects list for Defog and RapidSpin to only include PokemonEffect and TeamEffects
	Why is ItemSwapperEffect and SwapOpponentEffect a thing? just for generator?
	refactor RaiseCritsEffect -- apparently Focus Energy is supposed to raise by 2 and not stack with Dire Hit

	should movetypes be a set?
	generalize switch stat (Magic Room/Power Trick)

	make separate thingy for added methods in generator (instead of including in Field)
	BasicPanels fullMessagePanel -- Is 440 game.height - panel.height?

	look at natural cure again
	MoveUseItems do not work in battle -- causes NPE
	Purify doesn't work correctly
	Strength Sap should fail if the target has -6 Attack
	Heal Block doesn't work right either
	rewrite Ability.evolutionAssign() to hold the ability index to remain consistent across evolutions
	False Swipe -- remove the exact same effect, not just any bracing effect
	   - same deal with Me First
	Dancer -- test with Snatch (should not activate); test with Flinched (should not activate)
	test entering a new location while medals are displaying
	Explosion doesn't kill the user when used against a Ghost type Pokemon
	Rest shows the incorrect status prevent message -- just says "...but it failed!"
	can we throw a Pokeball at a semi-invulnerable Poke?

    add brick break to defog/rapid spin tests
    quick guard apparently not affected by successive decay?

    test healing wish and snatch
    rototiller should only work if Pokemon is grounded

    look at destiny bond and successive decay
    look at Ruby sprite on Serebii
    metronome + multi-turn move is not working (Dive)
    Wallet class (CashMoneyHouse?)
    change order of move list
    moves like core enforcer don't remove the effect if attack is unsuccessful
    check flinch with multi turn moves -- should it always reset ready? or just for like smack down?
    write tests for effects that if you use them twice it removes the effect (Wonder Room/Power Trick)
    can selfconfusion remove itself inside totalandcompletefailure?
    Message for Trick looks terrible when one of the Pokemon isn't holding anything (switched with Bulbasaur's No Item!)
    uproar specifically checks if pp runs out to remove effect -- should that be for other similar moves too?
    remove effect inside subside -- then we can use it in more places
    substitute almost certainly doesn't work with form change abilities for images at least
    fairy lock looks like it lasts indefinitely? but it should only be one turn?
    look at fling message update for white herb -- I don't think it will update the stats
    make Marcos fix the substitute failure messaging problems I don't wanna do it
    test moongeist beam and shadow shield (combos like that) -- honestly I don't even know how this is supposed to work
    does using a berry (not hold item) not count as berry consumption??
    probably have something to automatically remove previous effect if there can only be one (ChangeAbility etc)
    should I get different sprites for Castform and Arceus and other Pokemon like that since it's partially setup now
    cancelling evolution still consumes evolution item
    is there some way to have like a FirstTriggeredCondition or something for things like items and a lot of other shit
    is there a way to just create the button transitions from the button list by using all the button locations or something like that??
    can we rework printCast things? like pass in the alternate message to print instead of false?
    can we rewrite infiltrator to be like mold breaker or something? that shit is everywhere and I hate it
